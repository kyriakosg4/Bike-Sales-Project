# Bike-Sales-Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of bike buyers to gain insights into various patterns and behaviors. The analysis was conducted in Excel and includes data cleaning, the creation of new columns, and the development of pivot tables and charts to visualize the data.

## Data Cleaning

1. Removing Duplicates:

Duplicates were removed using the Remove Duplicates feature in the Data tab.

2. Replacing Gender Column Content:

The content of the Gender column was standardized by replacing 'M' and 'F' with 'Male' and 'Female' respectively using the Ctrl+H function.

3. Creating Age Brackets:

A new column named Age Brackets was created using an IF function to categorize each person according to their age.

## Pivot Tables and Charts

1. Average Income by Gender:

+ A clustered chart was created to show the average income with respect to gender.
+ This was done by creating a pivot table and then inserting a clustered column chart.

2. Customer Commute:

+ A line chart was developed to analyze the relationship between the number of customers who own bikes and the distance from their home.
+ This involved creating a pivot table and then inserting a line chart.
  
3. Bikes and Age Category:

+ Another line chart was created to illustrate the relationship between bike ownership and age categories.
+ This was done by creating a pivot table and inserting a line chart.
  
3. Owners vs. Non-Owners by Age:

+ A final line chart was created to compare the sum of bike owners and non-owners with respect to age.
+ This involved creating a pivot table and then inserting a line chart.
  
## Dashboard and Slicers

* A new sheet was created to compile all the charts.
* Slicers were added using the PivotChart Analyze tab -> Slicers feature.
* These slicers allow for dynamic interaction with the charts, enabling the user to filter the data and observe various behaviors and patterns based on the selected parameters.
  
## Usage

* Open the Excel file and navigate through the sheets to explore the data cleaning steps, pivot tables, and charts.
* Use the slicers on the dashboard sheet to interact with the charts and gain insights from the data.
  
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Excel. By following the steps outlined, you can replicate the analysis and explore the dataset to uncover valuable insights about bike buyers.
